[remove duplicates from sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
- my solution:get the array length, traverse through the array, compare every element with its former and pop duplicates
- optimal solution: have two pointers, one for the current "non-duplicate so far position", one traverse through the array like insertion sort.

[rotate array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)
- my solution: get the remainder "r" of num of rotation and array length, then chop the end "r" elements and put them at the front.

[merge two sorted lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
- my solution: exactly like the merge part in merge sort, but with list. simply set a temp node as head node and keep comparing elements in two arrays and add the smaller one as next of temp node.

[merge sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
- my solution: going backwards, compare elements and put the bigger one in the first array. Then simply slot in the remaining array.

[two sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- my solution: traverse through the list once, store the (needed_val,cur_index) in a hashmap, if cur_val is already a key, return map[cur_val] and the cur_index

[move-zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
- solution1: have a index of lastNoneZero, traverse through the array, when not zero, swap cur with lastNoneZero, lastNoneZero ++
- solution2: traverse through the array, pop zeros, append them back at the end (have a zero counter)
